    "## Measuring Curvature\n",
    "You're getting very close to a final result! You have a thresholded image, where you've estimated which pixels belong to the left and right lane lines (shown in red and blue, respectively, below), and you've fit a polynomial to those pixel positions. Next we'll compute the radius of curvature of the fit.\n",

    "An insightful student has suggested an alternative approach which may scale more efficiently. That is, once the parabola coefficients are obtained, in pixels, convert them into meters. For example, if the parabola is x= a*(y**2) +b*y+c; and mx and my are the scale for the x and y axis, respectively (in meters/pixel); then the scaled parabola is x= mx / (my ** 2) *a*(y**2)+(mx/my)*b*y+c\n",
